- Greetings! I am Telecoris! I just created myself a Github to ensure your fun here, I will be coding you a good and working full body tracking coming very, and I mean VERY soon.

- What is my new full body tracking?

- It is called Coris. Coris is not estimation, but at the same time is. You will be using your oculus IP and either a laptop, phone, TV or even your oculus. By not only using estimation, but your oculus trackers as
- well as using driver4vr to run Coris.

- There is yet no estimated release for Coris, as it certainly will NOT be worked on this week due to a vacation. 7/8/2023.

- Though, I have no team for help, but will gain some in the meantime. Coris does have a discord server, but is not finished. We can expect Coris to be tested on late 2024 due to resources and lack of activity.
